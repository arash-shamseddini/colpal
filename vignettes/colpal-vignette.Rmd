# Introduction

This document is prepared as a brief introduction to building EDI ([Environmental Dynamics Inc.](https://edynamics.com/)) Organizational Color Palette (referred to as OCP hereafter). This record is in core based on the **EDI Color Specifications** which is explained in detail in a document named **"Brand Standards 2017"** that can be found here.


There are lots of reasons to have an OCP in place [@colors-guide]: 

- Consistent colors will help to build a brand and hence more trust. 

- Visualizations will look more consistent no matter which tool you are using to create them.

- You and your team members will be able to think less about colors while creating plots.

<br>
EDI has established three colors to be used for its branding initiatives. The intent is that the colors are consistently and correctly represented given a specific application or general use.

The color specifications are listed in Table 1 and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:edi-standard-colors).

Applying these colors in the visual outputs (e.g. plots prepared for reports) immensely help with EDI **Brand Recognition** [@colors-brand]. 

As there is growing tendency within the company towards producing these visuals using robust tools such as the **R programming language** [@R-intro] (rather than MS Excel) and in particular the **ggplot2** package [@ggplot2-lib], the purpose of this effort is to streamline visualization tasks within the R landscape throughout EDI internal/external correspondences.

# Usage

`colpal` includes four functions, three of which are exported. These functions are demonstrated below with an example using the native `mtcars` data set [@mtcars-intro].

## `edi_cols` (Exported)

This function returns EDI colors (listed in Table 1) as pertinent hex codes. Its application is limited to situations where a single color is to be selected.

It takes the following for the input:

1- **one** of three colors as a **character**:

- "Warm Blue"
- "Burnt Orange"
- "Dark Blue"

and returns the related hex code.

In Figure \@ref(fig:ggplot-ex-1) an example for usage of `edi_cols_fun` with ggplot and in Figure \@ref(fig:base-r-ex-1) an example with base R is demonstrated.


```{r ggplot-ex-1, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Sample ggplot with Burnt Orange'}

# A ggplot example with edi_cols()
ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, ggplot2::aes(wt, mpg)) + ggplot2::geom_point(colour = edi_cols("Burnt Orange"), size = 5) + 
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Miles per Gallon vs Weight") + ggplot2::ylab("Miles per Gallon") + ggplot2::xlab("Weight (ton)") +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.line = ggplot2::element_line(),   # Removing grid, color & borders
        panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(),
        panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),
        panel.background = ggplot2::element_blank())
```



```{r base-r-ex-1, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Sample Base R plot with Warm Blue and Burnt Orange'}

# A Base R example with edi_cols()
plot(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, pch = 16, col= edi_cols("Warm Blue"),
 xlab = "Weight (ton)",
 ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
 xlim = c(2.5,5),
 ylim = c(15,30),        
 main = "Miles per Gallon vs Weight")
abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), lwd=2.0, col = edi_cols("Burnt Orange"))
```


## `edi_pal` (Non-exported)

This function technically spits out an interim function which in turn takes the number of levels within the interpolation as the input.

The `edi_pal_fun` takes the following for the input:

1- **One** of the EDI color palettes (e.g. "main", "blue", "mixed") as a **character** 

2- A **boolean** (`reverse = TRUE/FALSE`) for reversing or not reversing the palette

and returns the interim function which takes the following for the input:

1- Number of levels within interpolation (`n`) as a **numeric**

and returns an interpolation of the given palette in form of hex codes.


```{r}

# An example with edi_pal with main palette and 9 levels
# edi_pal("main")(9)
```

This interpolation of hex codes belong to an spectrum shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sample-palette-1).

```{r sample-palette-1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Nine shades of "main" palette'}
