The goal of colpal is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of colpal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arash-shamseddini/colpal")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(colpal)
library(ggplot2)

# Creating a sample bar plot using edi_cols function
ggplot(mpg, aes(x= class)) + geom_bar(fill=edi_cols("Warm Blue")) + # Using Warm Blue (as EDI Primary color)
  ggtitle("Number of cars in each class") +
  ylab("Count") + xlab("Class") +                                                   
  theme(axis.line = element_line(),   # Removing grids, backgroun color & borders
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank())
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
